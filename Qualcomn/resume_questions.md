### XR Perception R&D position
Based on the job description for a position in the Engineering Group, specifically within Systems Engineering at Qualcomm Semiconductor Limited, focusing on XR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality) Perception R&D, the interview questions are likely to cover a broad range of topics. These questions will not only assess the candidate's technical skills and experience but also their ability to contribute to Qualcomm's objectives in AR and VR technologies. Here are some of the most common interview questions that might be asked:

1. **Technical Expertise in Computer Vision and Machine Learning**
   - Can you explain the principles of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and how it applies to AR/VR technologies?
   ```
   SLAM是一种用于构建环境地图并确定自身位置的技术。在AR/VR中，SLAM技术用于实时地图构建和定位，以便将虚拟对象与现实世界对齐。SLAM技术通常涉及传感器数据融合、特征提取和匹配、优化算法等方面。

   流程通常包括：
   1. 传感器数据采集：使用相机、激光雷达、惯性测量单元（IMU）等传感器采集环境数据。
   2. 特征提取和匹配：从传感器数据中提取特征点，并将它们与先前的地图进行匹配。
   3. 优化算法：使用优化算法（如图优化或非线性优化）来估计相机姿态和地图结构。
   4. 实时定位和地图构建：在实时环境中更新地图并定位相机的位置。

   数据融合:
   - filter-based methods (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter)
   - optimization-based methods (e.g., Bundle Adjustment, Pose Graph Optimization)
   - deep learning-based methods (e.g., SLAMNet, VIO-Net)
